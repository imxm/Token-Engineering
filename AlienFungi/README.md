# Alien Fungi NFT Tokenomics

## **Introduction**
Alien Fungi is a Play-to-Earn (P2E) strategy game where players cultivate virtual land to grow mushrooms. Players must own an Alien Fungi NFT to participate, which grants access to a standard plot of land for mushroom cultivation. The game introduces an engaging economic system where players can harvest mushrooms and exchange them for $Fungi tokens, the in-game currency.

## **Game Economy Design**
### **Land**
- **Access Through NFT**: Ownership of an Alien Fungi NFT provides access to a standard piece of Farm Land.
- **Standard Yield**: Players can harvest a regular quantity of mushrooms on their standard plot.
- **Rental Options**: Players can rent higher-tier lands (Level 2 and Level 3) for enhanced mushroom yields.
- **Rental Costs**: Paid in $Fungi tokens, with costs scaling with land level.
- **Renewal of Rental**: Rental agreements must be renewed every seven days to continue harvesting.

### **Land Pricing**
| Land Type   | Mushrooms per Plot | Rent Cost ($Fungi) | Rent Cost per Day ($Fungi) |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| Standard    | 3                  | 0                  | 0                          |
| Level 2     | 6                  | 20                 | 2.86                       |
| Level 3     | 9                  | 50                 | 7.14                       |

### **Seeds**
- **Seed Growth**: Each NFT yields a seed every 24 hours, with a growth cycle involving planting, watering, and harvesting.
- **Risk of Poisonous Harvest**: There is a 33.33% chance of harvesting poisonous mushrooms, which yield no rewards but still require the standard cooldown period.

### **Potions**
Players can buy potions using $Fungi tokens to enhance their farming outcomes:
- **Pink Potion**: Reduces mushroom growth time by 50%.
- **Red Potion**: Prevents the cultivation of poisonous mushrooms.
- **Green Potion**: Offers a 40% chance to double yield or a 60% chance of no yield.

### **Potion Pricing**
| Potion Type | Cost in $Fungi Tokens |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| Pink Potion | 2                     |
| Red Potion  | 1.5                   |
| Green Potion| 1                     |

## **$Fungi Token**
- **Token Usage**: $Fungi tokens are the official in-game currency, used for purchases, participation in special events, and renting land.
- **Fixed Supply**: $Fungi tokens have a capped supply of 100 million.
- **Token Distribution**: $Fungi tokens are allocated for in-game rewards, airdrops, community incentives, marketing, and liquidity.

## **Demand Factor**
The demand factor measures player engagement by assessing the ratio of harvested mushrooms to the total potential yield within a specific time frame. It regulates $Fungi token emissions, ensuring alignment with player activity to maintain a balanced economy.

### **Token Emission Formula**
The reward pool for each period is dynamically adjusted based on the demand factor, with a cap to prevent oversupply and preserve the token's value.

## **One Token Model**
Alien Fungi employs a single-token model with a fixed supply, contrasting with the traditional dual-token models. This model unifies governance and economic power, placing it directly in the hands of active players. It simplifies the game's economy and promotes a cohesive player-driven ecosystem, avoiding the volatility and inflation risks associated with unlimited reward tokens.

## **Conclusion**
Alien Fungiâ€™s innovative game economy, driven by $Fungi tokens and strategic gameplay elements like land rentals, seed cultivation, and potion usage, offers a unique Play-to-Earn experience. The single-token model ensures a balanced and sustainable in-game economy, aligning the interests of players with the long-term health of the ecosystem.
