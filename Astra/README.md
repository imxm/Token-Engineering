# Astra Tokenomics Design by BlockApex

## **Abstract**
The Astra metaverse is a dynamic virtual world where users, through their customizable avatars known as Astranauts, can explore various cities, engage in events, shop in virtual stores, and participate in governance. The entire ecosystem is built around incentivizing participation through activity-based rewards, governance through Astra DAO, and a marketplace for NFT trading. 

## **Mechanism Design**
The Astra metaverse is built around five major components:

### **1. Cities in Astraverse**
- **Cities** are categorized by the type of events or experiences they host, such as gaming or shopping.
- **Toll Tax:** Astranauts must pay a toll tax to travel between cities, which is calculated based on the activity level of the city.

### **2. Cyberspaces**
- **Cyberspaces** are customizable land parcels where users can host events, sell NFTs, and more.
- There are 50,000 cyberspaces, each with its unique features and utility.
- **Revenue:** Cyberspace owners can earn revenue by charging event participation fees, securing sponsorships, and winning activity-based rebates.

### **3. Activities / Events in Cyberspaces**
- **Events:** Cyberspace owners can organize events with rewards, attract Astranauts, and collect fees.
- **Revenue Sharing:** A percentage of the fees earned from events is paid to the protocol.
- **Incentives:** Owners receive rebates and can advertise their events, enhancing visibility and engagement.

### **4. NFTs**
- **Virtual Experiences:** NFTs drive virtual experiences, allowing users to participate in events, design cyberspaces, and more.
- **Upgradability:** NFTs can be upgraded, rented, and traded, adding value and utility.
- **Meta Commerce:** Users can purchase physical items and receive corresponding virtual NFTs.

### **5. Astranauts**
- **AI Avatars:** Astranauts are upgradable avatars, essential for participating in the metaverse.
- **Governance:** Holding an Astranaut grants voting rights in the Astra DAO.
- **Activity-Based Rewards:** Astranauts can earn rewards by participating in events and engaging with the protocol.

## **Astra DAO**
The Astra DAO governs the protocol, with decisions made through community voting. Key governance details:
- **Voting Power:** Each Astranaut represents one vote.
- **Quorum:** 10% of total voting power is required to pass a proposal, with a 66.6% approval threshold.
- **Revenue Distribution:** A sustainability fund covers operational costs, with any shortfalls managed through reserves.

## **Astra Marketplace**
The **Astra Marketplace** is a centralized platform for trading NFTs, Avatars, and Cyberspaces within the protocol. Users can buy, sell, and upgrade their assets in this marketplace.

## **Game Theory**
### **Protocol - Activity-Based Rewarding Mechanism**
- **Activity Measurement:** Rewards are based on the transaction fees generated by users and cyberspaces, incentivizing active participation.
- **Subsidy Pool:** Rewards are distributed from a subsidy pool, with the top five users or cyberspaces receiving proportional rewards based on activity.

### **Soulbound Tokens**
- **Soulbound Tokens** are non-transferable NFTs tied to specific experiences, providing exclusive access to certain events and activities.

### **Protocol-Owned Advertisement Spots**
- **Advertisements:** The protocol owns advertisement slots in prime locations, which can be allocated free of charge to high-engagement cyberspaces or auctioned to the highest bidder.

### **Activities Feedback Mechanism**
- **Event Feedback:** Participants rate events, with event taxes adjusted based on the average rating.

### **Architects / Creators' Incentives**
- **Creator Fund:** Designers and creators are incentivized to contribute by not being charged an initial fee to design cyberspaces.
- **Creator Fund Rewards:** The top five creators are rewarded based on growth KPIs such as asset deployment and price growth.

### **Growth KPIs**
- The **Growth KPIs** determine the reward distribution from the creator fund, focusing on asset deployment, inflation rate, price growth, and average price per asset.

### **Grants**
- Creators can claim additional funds through grants by submitting a proposal to the DAO.

### **One Person, One Avatar**
- **Single Avatar Policy:** Users are incentivized to own only one avatar, as holding multiple avatars dilutes their ability to generate activity-based rewards and participate effectively in the ecosystem.

## **Conclusion**
The Astra metaverse is designed to create a vibrant, interactive, and economically sustainable virtual world. Through a combination of NFTs, decentralized governance, and activity-based incentives, Astra ensures that users, creators, and cyberspace owners are all rewarded for their contributions, fostering a thriving and engaged community.
