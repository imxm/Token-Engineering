# $ELTK Token Utility Module Overview

### **Token Structure**
- **$ELTK**: The native ERC-20 token for the Elektrik protocol, serving as the base utility token within the system.
- **$veELTK**: An ERC-721 governance token in the form of an NFT, created when $ELTK holders lock their tokens. The amount of $veELTK received is proportional to the lock period, incentivizing long-term staking.

### **Vote-Escrow Mechanism**
The vote-escrow mechanism incentivizes long-term holding of $ELTK tokens by providing $veELTK in return, which grants voting power in protocol governance. This model supports price stability and liquidity by rewarding users who commit to longer lock periods.

### **Voting Power and Process**
- **Voting Power**: $ELTK holders can lock tokens for up to 4 years, receiving $veELTK in return. The amount of $veELTK determines the user's voting power.
- **Voting Process**: $veELTK holders vote on $ELTK emissions distribution across liquidity pools. Voters earn a 40% share of trading fees from the pools they vote for, encouraging active governance participation.

### **Bribes and Whitelisted Pools**
- **Bribes**: External rewards can be added to incentivize voting on specific pools. These bribes are distributed among voters of the respective pool, enhancing governance participation.
- **Whitelisted Pools**: Only specific, approved pools can receive bribes, ensuring controlled and beneficial governance actions.

### **Swap Fees and Emissions**
- **Swap Fees**: A standard fee is charged on every trade, distributed among LPs, $veELTK holders, and the protocol. LPs receive 50% of the fees, while $veELTK holders and the protocol share the remaining amount.
- **Emissions**: Initially, emissions are fixed for 6 months, followed by a dynamic model based on network activity. Emissions aim to maintain a 0.3% weekly ROI for liquidity providers.

### **Rebasing Mechanism**
A rebasing mechanism prevents dilution of voting power as $ELTK supply increases. $veELTK holders receive additional $ELTK tokens proportional to their voting power and the emissions, helping to maintain influence over time.

### **Tokenomics**
The tokenomics structure is designed to support long-term growth and sustainability. Emissions are allocated carefully across various stakeholders, including LPs, $veELTK holders, and the treasury.

### **Summary**
The $ELTK token utility module integrates a vote-escrow mechanism, dynamic emissions, and a rebasing strategy to ensure a balanced and incentivized ecosystem. By encouraging long-term participation and rewarding governance involvement, Elektrik aims to maintain a healthy and engaged community.
