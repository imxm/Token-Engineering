- **Influencers** can vote on product ideas, promote them, and earn rewards based on campaign performance.
- **Consumers** can interact with products through referral links or directly via the Infra DApp.

### **Agents of the System**
1. **Brand Owners/Advertisers**: Create proposals, set budgets, and choose payment modules (e.g., Pay per Click, Pay per Impression).
2. **Influencers/Distributors**: Stake tokens to participate, vote on proposals, and promote products.
3. **Consumers/Product Users**: Interact with products through referral links or directly on the platform.

### **Referral Farming**
A unique feature allowing influencers to earn rewards by successfully referring users to buy and hold tokens of promoted projects.

### **KPI Score**
Influencers are evaluated based on a KPI score, which includes factors like staking amount, campaign participation, and community engagement. The score influences voting power and rewards.

## **Economic Model**
### **Budget Allocation**
- **70%** of the budget is allocated to influencers and users.
- **20%** is used for token buybacks and burns to maintain token value.
- **10%** is reserved by the protocol as a safeguard.

### **Reward Distribution**
- 60% to influencers.
- 30% for pyramid rewards (referrals).
- 5% for user cashbacks.

### **Staking Mechanism**
Influencers must stake tokens to gain access to the platform, with no upper limit on the staking amount, which contributes to their KPI score.

### **Voting Mechanism**
Influencers vote on product proposals, determining whether they are whitelisted for promotion based on the majority vote.

### **Pyramid Scheme**
If a user becomes an influencer through another influencer's referral, the parent influencer earns a percentage of the descendant’s earnings, promoting network growth.

## **Game Theoretic Principles**
### **Incentives**
- Influencers are incentivized to promote high-quality products and maintain high KPI scores.
- Product owners are incentivized to optimize their campaigns by choosing trustworthy influencers.
- Consumers are rewarded with cashbacks and early access to new products.

### **Disincentives**
- Malicious behaviors like fake clicks or impressions are penalized through slashing mechanisms, impacting the influencer’s KPI score and credibility.

## **Conclusion**
