# LightLink Airdrop Strategy Overview

### **Introduction**
The LightLink Airdrop is a strategic initiative aimed at fostering community growth, liquidity provision, and ecosystem engagement for the LightLink platform. The airdrop will span six months, divided into three distinct phases, each focusing on different aspects of the platform's development, from community engagement to financial stability and dApp utilization.

### **Airdrop Phases**
1. **Phase 1: Community Engagement & Asset Bridging**
   - Focuses on building a strong community through social media engagement and incentivizing users to bridge assets onto the LightLink L2 platform.
   - Tasks include social media interaction, bridging assets, and bug reporting.

2. **Phase 2: Financial Stability**
   - Aims to solidify the platform's financial foundations by focusing on metrics like Total Value Locked (TVL), trading volume, and liquidity provision.
   - Introduction of the liquidity lockdrop module during this phase.

3. **Phase 3: dApp and Smart Contract Interaction**
   - Emphasizes the utility of dApps and smart contracts on the platform, with a focus on generating trading volume within these applications.
   - Tasks involve interacting with dApps, providing liquidity, and maintaining trading activity.

### **Task Categories**
- **Social Media Engagement & Community Growth**: Engage with LightLink's social channels and participate in campaigns to earn points.
- **Mainnet/Testnet Activities, Bug Reporting & Feedback**: Test platform features, report bugs, and provide feedback to help improve the platform.
- **Bridging Assets to LightLink**: Conduct and maintain a certain number of bridging transactions and asset volumes.
- **Generating Trading Volume**: Participate in trades and maintain trading volumes on the platform.
- **Interaction with dApps/Smart Contracts**: Engage with various dApps and smart contracts on the LightLink network.
- **Liquidity Provision**: Provide liquidity on the LightLink network and maintain it over time.

### **KPI Measurement and Quadratic Scoring**
- **Quadratic Scoring**: Rewards participants based on the square root of tasks completed, encouraging broad participation and minimizing the influence of large players (whales).
- **KPI-Driven Base Points**: Tasks are weighted based on key performance indicators (KPIs) set for each phase, ensuring the airdrop incentivizes actions that align with the platform's goals.

### **Distribution Methodology**
- **Tier-Based Distribution**: Participants are categorized into four tiers—Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze—based on their leaderboard standings. Each tier receives a proportionate share of the airdrop budget, with rewards distributed equitably among participants.

### **Claiming Mechanism**
- **NFT Drop**: After each phase, participants receive an NFT representing their airdrop score. These NFTs can be locked for additional rewards or traded on secondary markets. The longer the lock-in period, the higher the reward multiplier.
- **Performance-Based Distribution**: Participants can claim their airdropped tokens based on their performance on the network, with options for linear vesting or staggered distribution.

### **NFT Airdrop Suggestion**
- Participants receive NFTs after Phase 1, which represent their airdrop score. These NFTs can be upgraded or traded based on their lock-in period, with rarer NFTs awarded for longer vesting periods.

### **Conclusion**
The LightLink Airdrop strategy is designed to incentivize a broad range of actions that contribute to the platform's growth and sustainability. Through a combination of community engagement, liquidity provision, and dApp interaction, the airdrop aims to build a robust and active user base while establishing the LightLink network as a leading Layer 2 solution.
