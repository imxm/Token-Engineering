# Push The Button (PTB) Game Mechanics

### **Overview**
"Push The Button" (PTB) is a free-to-play game where players push a button to earn an in-game sub-currency called `$BUTTONZ`. This currency can be used to purchase power-ups, boosts, and premium currency called `$PUSH`. `$PUSH` can be spent on premium items like booster packs, game customizations, and participation in play-to-earn aspects of the game.

### **Game Economy Design**
The PTB game economy was meticulously crafted to balance player engagement, reward distribution, and in-game currency management. The design includes mechanisms for daily participation, cooldown timers, dynamic reward systems, and strategic power-ups, ensuring a fair and engaging experience for all players.

### **Key Components**

- **Daily Push Limit and Cooldown**: Players can push the button up to 100 times a day, with cooldowns increasing incrementally after each push. This system encourages strategic gameplay while ensuring fairness.

- **$BUTTONZ Acquisition**: Players earn `$BUTTONZ` with each push, ranging from 0 to 5 `$BUTTONZ` per push. Special events and streaks provide additional opportunities for earning.

- **XP System**: Players earn XP with each push, which determines their progression in the game. The XP system encourages consistent engagement, with rewards scaling based on player activity.

- **Power-Ups and Events**: The game features various power-ups that can be purchased with `$BUTTONZ` to enhance earning potential. Special events like Happy Hour, Tap-a-Thon Mania, and Global Tapping provide additional incentives for participation.

- **Loot Raffle**: A daily loot raffle allows players to exchange `$BUTTONZ` for `$PUSH`, adding a layer of excitement and reward to the gameplay.

- **$PUSH Staking and Burns**: Players can stake `$PUSH` to earn additional rewards. The game also incorporates mechanisms for burning `$PUSH`, maintaining the value of the premium currency over time.

### **Game Development Approach**
The development of PTB's game economy was guided by principles of fairness, player engagement, and long-term sustainability. We implemented dynamic reward systems, carefully designed progression models, and strategic events to keep the gameplay interesting and rewarding. The economy is designed to be self-sustaining, with in-game activities funded by trading fees and controlled emissions of `$PUSH`.

### **Conclusion**
PTB's game mechanics are designed to create a balanced and engaging experience for players, rewarding consistent participation while maintaining the long-term sustainability of the game economy. Whether you're pushing the button, participating in events, or staking `$PUSH`, the game offers a variety of ways to play and earn, making it a compelling addition to the gaming ecosystem.
