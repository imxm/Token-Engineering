# SPAY Watch-to-Earn Protocol

## **Executive Summary**
The SPAY Watch-to-Earn protocol allows users to mint three types of glasses: Common, Rare, and SuperScript. Each glass type has unique attributes and rewards users for watching content. SPAY tokens are burned in various compulsory and optional events to maintain the token’s value. The protocol follows a freemium model to onboard users, offering 15,000 free Common glasses initially. Users must stake SPAY tokens to earn rewards, with additional opportunities to upgrade their glasses, enhance attributes, and increase rewards.

## **Economics**
### **Demand**
Demand for SPAY tokens is driven by three compulsory burnable events: Minting, Recharging, and Buying Gems. An optional burnable event includes opening Mystery Boxes.

### **Supply**
Supply of SPAY tokens is managed through rewards for watching content, offset by compulsory burn events to prevent inflation.

## **Mechanism Design**
### **Glass Types**
Users can mint Common, Rare, and SuperScript glasses, each with different attributes like Efficiency, Durability, and Luck. Higher glass types offer better rewards but are rarer.

### **Base Attributes**
Attributes such as Efficiency, Durability, and Luck influence the user’s watch time and rewards. Users can upgrade these attributes by reaching milestones and purchasing gems.

### **Base Reward**
Base rewards are calculated per energy depletion and are influenced by attributes like Efficiency and Loyalty. The protocol includes a Demand Factor to control emissions based on platform activity.

### **Milestones and Loot Boxes**
Milestones incentivize users to watch more content, unlocking upgrades and rewards. Loot boxes offer gamification elements, including rewards like free recharges and referral links.

### **Mint, Recharge, and Gem Costs**
Costs are structured to ensure users remain engaged and committed to the platform before breaking even.

### **Allowable Watch Time**
Daily watch time limits vary across glass types to control token emissions and ensure fair rewards distribution.

### **Token Locking**
Users must lock SPAY tokens to participate in the ecosystem and earn rewards. The lock period varies depending on the glass type.

### **Content Voting Rights**
Users can vote on new content by burning SPAY tokens, with voting power proportional to the tokens burned.

## **Model Explanation**
The protocol’s financial model includes stress tests to gauge token emissions in adverse scenarios. It incorporates base matrices, pricing sheets, and a demand factor to ensure sustainability.

### **Financial Model and Stress Tests**
Stress tests simulate worst-case scenarios, like maximum token emissions and early token dumps, to validate the protocol’s resilience.

## **Pool Composition & Token Emission Dynamics**
The protocol’s initial pool composition and token supply are designed to maintain a balanced emission rate and ensure long-term sustainability.

## **Game Theory**
Game theory elements include free mints, pricing strategies, exponential growth of attributes, loyalty multipliers, and token locking to incentivize user participation and token value preservation.

## **Disincentivization Mechanism**
To prevent Sybil attacks and ensure consistent user engagement, the protocol monitors user activity and auctions inactive glasses, burning a portion of the proceeds.

## **Appendix**
The appendix provides detailed tables and matrices for attributes, pricing, rewards, and other key metrics used in the protocol.
